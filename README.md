# Windows Commander MCP

Windows Commander MCP is a `.NET 10` stdio MCP server that gives MCP clients
(Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and other compatible hosts) hands-on control of
a Windows desktop: windows, input, screen capture, UI Automation, processes,
registry, services, files, clipboard, and shell.

## Status

Stable and ready to use. The server exposes ~57 tools covering the core
Windows desktop surface, ships pre-built self-contained binaries on the
[GitHub Releases page](../../releases), and is exercised end-to-end by three
test harnesses on every change (`tools/smoke-mcp.ps1`, `tools/mutate-mcp.ps1`,
`tools/drive-mcp.ps1`).

### Capabilities

- **Process & window orchestration** — discovery, search, focus, move/resize,
  state management, child-window enumeration, foreground-activation that
  survives the Windows 11 background-activation revert.
- **Hardware input simulation** — mouse, keyboard, hotkeys, scroll, cursor
  position, scripted input sequences.
- **Reliable text entry** — `type_text` uses clipboard paste (preserving all
  original clipboard formats) instead of `SendInput`, which drops and repeats
  characters past ~12 events.
- **Vision** — full-screen, per-monitor, and region screen capture; on-device
  OCR via `Windows.Media.Ocr` (reads pixels, not just UIA metadata); visual
  candidate detection.
- **UI Automation** — tree read with depth/filter controls and a `truncated`
  flag, find/invoke/set value, element details.
- **Display & screen metadata** — display metrics, screen identification,
  window-to-screen mapping, virtual-screen coordinates throughout.
- **Execution** — PowerShell and native process execution, process control,
  Windows notifications.
- **System state** — clipboard (text), environment variables, system info,
  Windows services, registry reads, installed apps + launching.
- **File system & shell** — list, read, write, copy/move/delete, file
  properties with optional SHA256/SHA1/MD5 hashes, open paths, show in
  Explorer, search files.
- **Safety layer** — local Win32 confirmation dialog for high-risk tools,
  per-monitor pulsing border indicator, audio cue, activity-chip queue, and
  a bounded persistent audit log with sensitive-argument redaction.

See [`docs/tool-coverage.md`](docs/tool-coverage.md) for the full per-tool
list.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 interactive desktop session.
- .NET 10 Desktop Runtime (already bundled with the self-contained release
  package; only required as a separate install if you build from source or
  use the non-self-contained package).
- PowerShell 7+ available as `pwsh.exe` for `execute_powershell`.

Some tools need an interactive desktop session. Elevated target applications
may not be controllable from a non-elevated server process.

## Install (release package)

Each tagged release publishes a ready-to-run, self-contained package on the
[GitHub Releases page](../../releases) — no .NET runtime or build tools
needed on the target machine.

1. Download `windows-commander-mcp-v<version>-win-x64.zip` from the latest
   release.
2. (Optional) Verify it against the published `.sha256` file:
   `(Get-FileHash <zip> -Algorithm SHA256).Hash`.
3. Unzip it to a stable folder, e.g. `C:\Tools\windows-commander-mcp`.
4. Point your MCP client's `.mcp.json` at the `WindowsCommander.McpServer.exe`
   at the root of the unzipped folder (see [MCP Client Configuration](#mcp-client-configuration)).

Releases are produced automatically: pushing a `v*` git tag runs the
`.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow, which tests, packages, and publishes
the zip.

### Building a package locally

`tools/package-release.ps1` builds the same zip without GitHub Actions:

```powershell
pwsh tools/package-release.ps1 -Version 0.1.0
```

It publishes the server **self-contained** and writes
`dist\windows-commander-mcp-v<version>-win-x64.zip`. For a smaller package
that requires the .NET 10 Desktop Runtime on the host, pass
`-SelfContained $false`.

## MCP Client Configuration

The server is a stdio MCP server: the MCP client launches the executable and
talks to it over stdin/stdout. Point your client's `.mcp.json` at the
`WindowsCommander.McpServer.exe` you unzipped from the release package, using
its full absolute path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-commander": {
      "command": "C:\\Tools\\windows-commander-mcp\\WindowsCommander.McpServer.exe",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

High-risk tools (process kills, file writes/deletes, environment changes,
script execution) prompt for local confirmation by default. To disable the
prompt for unattended or automated hosts, add an `env` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-commander": {
      "command": "C:\\Tools\\windows-commander-mcp\\WindowsCommander.McpServer.exe",
      "args": [],
      "env": { "WINDOWS_COMMANDER_UNATTENDED": "1" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Safety Model

The safety layer is implemented and enabled by default.

- **Risk classification** — `RiskPolicyService` marks destructive or
  command-execution tools as high risk; `ToolDispatcher` consults it on
  every call.
- **Confirmation dialog** — high-risk tools (process kills, file writes/
  deletes, environment changes, script execution) block on a local Win32
  confirmation dialog until the local user answers; a timeout counts as
  denied. Set `WINDOWS_COMMANDER_UNATTENDED=1` to bypass for automated hosts.
- **Visual control indicators** — a per-monitor pulsing border overlay frames
  every screen during a computer-use action; high-risk actions glow orange
  with a ⚠ marker. The overlay never activates, so it cannot steal focus.
  Recent actions render as a labelled chip queue along the glow's top edge.
- **Audio cue** — short non-intrusive sound on every computer-use call.
- **Audit log** — every tool invocation is retained in a bounded in-memory view and
  persisted as redacted JSONL so restart diagnostics survive MCP process loss. Sensitive
  argument names (`password`, `token`, `secret`, `key`) are never persisted raw.

See [`docs/safety.md`](docs/safety.md).

## Tunnel reliability controls

Long-running MCP calls are bounded before an upstream tunnel response deadline can expire. The default request budget is 90 seconds, and serialized text responses are capped at 512 KiB. Configure these only when the hosting transport has compatible limits:

- `WINDOWS_COMMANDER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` - request budget, clamped to 5,000..110,000 ms.
- `WINDOWS_COMMANDER_MAX_TEXT_RESULT_BYTES` - text response cap, clamped to 65,536..4,194,304 bytes.
- `WINDOWS_COMMANDER_AUDIT_LOG` - persistent audit JSONL path; defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WindowsCommander\audit.jsonl`.

For a process that must continue beyond the request budget, start it with `execute_process` and `wait_for_exit=false`, then inspect it with process tools instead of holding one MCP request open.

## Known Limitations

- `clipboard_access` supports the `text` format only; `html`,
  `file_drop_list`, and `image` are pending.
- `copy_move_delete_path` supports `copy`, `move`, and permanent `delete`;
  `recycle` (move to Recycle Bin) is pending.
- `get_file_properties` returns metadata, version info, and hashes but does
  not yet include alternate data stream names or a security descriptor
  summary.
- Persistent audit records intentionally contain redacted arguments only; sensitive values cannot be recovered after restart.

## Build from source

```powershell
dotnet build WindowsCommander.slnx -c Release
dotnet test  WindowsCommander.slnx -c Release
dotnet publish src/WindowsCommander.McpServer/WindowsCommander.McpServer.csproj -c Release -r win-x64
```

The published executable is:

```text
src\WindowsCommander.McpServer\bin\Release\net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0\win-x64\publish\WindowsCommander.McpServer.exe
```

Note: a running server holds a lock on its own DLLs, so `dotnet publish`
fails while an MCP client has the server connected. Disconnect the server
in your MCP client (e.g. `/mcp` in Claude Code) before republishing, or use
the test harnesses below, which spawn a fresh server process each run.

## Test Harnesses

Three PowerShell scripts drive the published exe directly over stdio JSON-RPC
without involving an MCP client. Each spawns its own server and shuts it
down, so they do not require disconnecting an attached Claude Code session.

```powershell
pwsh tools/smoke-mcp.ps1    # fast: 35 read-only checks, PASS/FAIL matrix
pwsh tools/mutate-mcp.ps1   # 25 side-effecting checks, self-cleaning
pwsh tools/drive-mcp.ps1    # end-to-end typing + capture into artifacts/
```

## Run Locally (raw stdio)

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/WindowsCommander.McpServer/WindowsCommander.McpServer.csproj
```

The server communicates over line-delimited JSON-RPC via stdio.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"get_system_info","arguments":{}}}
```

## Manual Validation

See [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md) for manual test cases.

## Design Goals

- Keep MCP tool handlers thin; keep Windows-specific APIs behind services.
- Make destructive and computer-control operations observable and auditable.
- Use Windows virtual-screen coordinates consistently for input, capture,
  and overlays.
- Prefer local Windows/.NET-compatible dependencies; no cloud OCR or vision
  services.
